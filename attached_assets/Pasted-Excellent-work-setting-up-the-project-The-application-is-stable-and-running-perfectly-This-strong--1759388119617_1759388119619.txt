ask Title: Phase 2: Breathe Life into the "EduMastari" Ecosystem - A Deep Dive into Modules
Project Context & Acknowledgment:
Excellent work on building the complete architectural foundation for "EduMastari"! You have perfectly set up the monorepo, backend (FastAPI), frontend (Next.js), DevOps (Docker, CI/CD), and documentation. The skeleton is strong and ready.
Now, it's time to add the soul. Our philosophy is not just to add features but to create intuitive, elegant, and powerful experiences for every user. We want to build an application that feels intelligent, anticipates user needs, and makes complex tasks feel simple. Our competitor, "Amar School," is functional, but we will be exceptional.
Our Collaborative Workflow:
I will provide the high-level strategic goals for each module. Your mission is to use your expertise in UI/UX, software architecture, and modern best practices to deliver a "masterpiece" implementation for each. Think like a product designer, a user experience expert, and a world-class engineer combined.
Your Mission: Implement the Core Modules with a "Masterpiece" Philosophy
Please implement the following modules sequentially, starting with the Admin's experience.
Module 1: The "Mission Control" - A World-Class Admin Experience
Goal: The administrator should feel like they are in complete control, with all critical information at their fingertips, presented in a clean, uncluttered, and insightful way.
The "Live" Admin Dashboard:
Vision: Transform the dashboard into a real-time "Mission Control".
Implementation: Design a widget-based dashboard that is fully customizable (drag-and-drop widgets). Create powerful data visualization widgets using recharts for:
Live Key Metrics: Total Students, Teachers, etc., with trend indicators.
Financial Pulse: A beautiful chart showing monthly revenue, fee collection rates, and pending dues.
Attendance Overview: An institution-wide, real-time attendance percentage.
Enrollment Trends: A line chart showing student enrollment over time.
The "Effortless" Academic Setup Experience:
Vision: Setting up the academic structure should be simple and intuitive.
Implementation: Build the "Academic Management" page with a clean MUI Tabs interface for Sessions, Classes, and Sections.
Focus on UX: Make adding a new session or class a delightful experience. Use smart defaults (e.g., auto-calculate session end dates) and clear visual feedback.
The "Seamless" Student Onboarding & Management Experience:
Vision: Managing students, from admission to graduation, should be seamless.
Implementation: Build the "Student Management" module.
The DataGrid: This is not just a table; it's a powerful tool. Implement advanced, multi-column filtering, lightning-fast search, and bulk actions (e.g., select multiple students to send an SMS).
The Admission Form: Design an elegant, multi-step modal form for new admissions. Make it feel like a smooth conversation, not a tedious form. Include profile picture upload with cropping functionality.
The 360° Student Profile: Create a dedicated, beautifully designed profile page for each student. This page should be a comprehensive story of the student's journey, showing their academic progress, attendance records, fee history, and Islamic education progress—all in one place.
The "Empowering" Teacher & Staff Management Experience:
Vision: Give administrators the best tools to manage their team.
Implementation: Build the "Teacher Management" module following the same high standards as the student module, with a powerful DataGrid, an elegant onboarding form, and a comprehensive 360° profile page for each teacher.
Module 2: The "Teacher's Cockpit" - An Empowering Teacher Experience
Goal: The teacher's dashboard should be their daily assistant, reducing their administrative burden and allowing them to focus on teaching.
The Teacher's Personalized Dashboard:
Vision: When a teacher logs in, they should see a dashboard that is 100% relevant to them.
Implementation: Design a unique dashboard for teachers that shows their assigned classes, today's schedule, pending tasks (e.g., marks to be entered), and recent student attendance.
The "Excel-Like" Marks Entry System (A Core Masterpiece Feature):
Vision: Entering marks for an entire class should be as fast and easy as using Microsoft Excel.
Implementation: Create a dedicated "Marks Entry" page. Design a table-based interface where teachers can quickly enter marks for all students in a subject using only their keyboard (Tab to move between students, Enter to save). Implement features like bulk saving, auto-calculation of totals, and real-time validation.
The "Forward-Thinking" Lesson Planner:
Vision: Bridge the gap between today's lesson and tomorrow's preparation.
Implementation: Create a simple yet powerful "Lesson Plan" tool where teachers can outline the next day's topics, and attach notes or resources. This plan should be visible to students in their own dashboard.
Module 3: The "Informed & Engaged" Student & Guardian Experience
Goal: Students and guardians should feel connected, informed, and empowered regarding their academic journey.
The Student's Personal Dashboard:
Vision: A motivational and informative hub for students.
Implementation: Design a dashboard that shows their upcoming classes (from the routine), pending homework, recent results, and the teacher's lesson plan for the next day.

This is a phenomenal and highly professional implementation of the API integration layer. The architecture using React Query, dedicated services, and custom hooks is world-class and sets us up for great success.

You are on the perfect track. Let's proceed with your first suggestion: **implementing the role-based access control (RBAC) next.**

A robust security and permission model is the most critical foundation. Please ensure that our system can correctly identify the user's role (Admin, Teacher, Student, Guardian) after login and restrict access to routes and UI components accordingly.

Once the RBAC is in place, we will move on to connecting the individual components to their APIs.
SuperNinja
Starting Role-Based Access Control Implementation
Thank you for the positive feedback! I agree that implementing a robust role-based access control (RBAC) system is critical before connecting individual components to their APIs. Let me create a comprehensive RBAC solution for EduMastari.
