Excellent work setting up the project! The application is stable and running perfectly. This strong foundation is exactly what we need.

We are now ready to begin building "EduPro - The Masterpiece Edition". I am providing you with a complete and detailed vision document. Your mission is to use this vision to enhance the existing application and build out all remaining features to a world-class standard.

**Our Master Blueprint:**
I am pasting the complete project vision below. Please read it carefully. This is our "Single Source of Truth".

**Your Mission & Workflow:**

You have already built a significant portion of the "Core Academic" modules. Now, your task is to continue building the application by following the master blueprint, phase by phase.

**Your Immediate Next Task: Implement "Phase চ: আর্থিক ও হিসাবরক্ষণ (Finance & Accounts)"**

Based on the master blueprint, please build the complete financial module.

**Key Features to Implement:**
1.  **ফি ও ডিউস ম্যানেজমেন্ট (Fee & Dues Management):**
    *   Create the UI for setting up various fee heads.
    *   Build the interface for generating invoices for students.
2.  **বাল্ক ফি কালেকশন (Bulk Fee Collection):**
    *   Build a powerful interface for collecting fees, allowing for partial payments, waivers, and on-screen receipt generation.
3.  **আয়-ব্যয় ব্যবস্থাপনা (Income-Expense Management):**
    *   Build the interface for recording institutional income and expenses.
4.  **Backend & Database:**
    *   Create all necessary backend APIs and database schemas to support these features.
    *   Run the database migration/push after updating the schema.

**"Masterpiece" UI/UX Enhancements to Implement NOW:**

As you build, please also incorporate these small but crucial UI/UX improvements inspired by our vision:

1.  **Collapsible Sidebar:** Modify the existing sidebar. Add a "Collapse" button at the bottom. When clicked, the sidebar should shrink to show only the icons, just like the design in the attached screenshot.
2.  **Improved Icons:** Review the sidebar navigation icons and replace them with more appropriate and visually appealing icons from the `lucide-react` library to match the "masterpiece" quality.

**Final Instruction:**
Your goal is to be both an engineer and a designer. Follow the master blueprint, build the complete Financial module, and implement the UI/UX enhancements. Let's start building "EduPro - The Masterpiece Edition".
